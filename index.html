        <h2>Hi everyone, I'm Michelle Mason!</h2>
        <p>I am currently a software engineering student at Thinkful, and I reside in sunny Redondo Beach, California. My passion for learning code is as hot as the Southern California sun, and I can't wait to become a master in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I'm an always positive go getter who likes to be solution oriented. When faced with issues, I immediately focus on a solution and encourage those around me to stay motivated. My goal is to eventually be part of a team that I can inspire that also pushes me to grow.

      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <div class="group">
      <div class="item">
        <p>My background is in public health and I look forward to the opportunity to use my social and analytical skills learned there to become an asset in the tech industry. While being a part of the public health world, I noticed that I wasn't being stimulated and my mind wasn't being challenged. I craved a change that would offer me that stimulation on a daily basis. The challenging world of code excites me and motivates me to find solutions, which is exactly what I was searching for! Coding forces me to grow and learn and I am so excited to be a part of the tech world.</p> 
        <p>When I do break into the tech industry, I want to be part of a team that collaborates and encourages each other to create new ideas. I want to work alongside great programmers who are always ready and willing to learn and try something new. Both with my team and independently, I want to be able to solive people's problems and help make their lives easier. Using seamless tech applications, no matter how big or small, I hope to have an impact on people's lives all over the world.</p>
        <p>Some services I want to be able to offer clients include handling the integration of all graphics, creating and testing applications, and overall bringing their web dreams to reality. I want to be able to hear what they want, and then create it even better than they expected.</p> 
        <p>When I'm not diving into the coding world, I love to spend my time outside. I am an avid fisher, hiker, and will try to go camping every chance I get. I also really love cooking and find myself connecting with my creative side in the kitchen. Cooking a fresh catch on a campfire grill is my idea of the perfect time!</p>

        <h3>Pretend Project 1: Sporky</h3>
          <p>This is an app that I made to create a recipe based on the ingredients you have in your home. This app was created because I love cooking and can be used by anyone. The languages I would have used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Pretend Project 2: ReelIn</h3>
          <p>This is an app that would take in your input of characteristics of a fish you just got and return to you the species of fish. This app was created because I love fishing and have always wanted an app that could do this. Anyone can use it, and I would have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Pretend Project 3: Wino</h3>
          <p>This is an app that would keep track of all the wines you buy and keep your personal rating on them. I created this to help keep track of the different wines people have tried and so they can remember the ones they liked or didn't. I would have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
