        <h2>Hi everyone, I'm Michelle Mason!</h2>
        <p>I am currently a software engineering student at Thinkful, and I reside in sunny Redondo Beach, California. My passion for learning code is as hot as the Southern California sun, and I can't wait to become a master in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p>I'm an always positive go getter who likes to be solution oriented. When faced with issues, I immediately focus on a solution and encourage those around me to stay motivated. My goal is to eventually be part of a team that I can inspire that also pushes me to grow.

      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <div class="group">
      <div class="item">
        <p>My background is in public health and I look forward to the opportunity to use my social and analytical skills learned there to become an asset in the tech industry. While being a part of the public health world, I noticed that I wasn't being stimulated and my mind wasn't being challenged. I craved a change that would offer me that stimulation on a daily basis. The challenging world of code excites me and motivates me to find solutions, which is exactly what I was searching for! Coding forces me to grow and learn and I am so excited to be a part of the tech world.</p> 
        <p>When I do break into the tech industry, I want to be part of a team that collaborates and encourages each other to create new ideas. I want to work alongside great programmers who are always ready and willing to learn and try something new. Both with my team and independently, I want to be able to solive people's problems and help make their lives easier. Using seamless tech applications, no matter how big or small, I hope to have an impact on people's lives all over the world.</p>
        <p>When I'm not diving into the coding world, I love to spend my time outside. I am an avid fisher, hiker, and will try to go camping every chance I get. I also really love cooking and find myself connecting with my creative side in the kitchen. Cooking a fresh catch on a campfire grill is my idea of the perfect time!</p>
